Concurrently, ISRO's space-tech applications in agriculture reveal paradoxes: satellite imagery helps 62% of large farms monitor crops, yet smallholders lack smartphones to access this data. The Ayushman Bharat health scheme mirrors this dichotomy - despite 500 million enrollments, rural hospital beds per 1,000 remain at 0.7 versus WHO's 3.5 benchmark.
