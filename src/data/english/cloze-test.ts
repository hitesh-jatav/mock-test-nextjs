      answer: "A",

        "The phrase 'impacting vulnerable communities worldwide' suggests an increasing commonality and widespread nature of these events, making 'prevalent' (widespread, common) the most suitable word.

      answer: "C",
      explanation:
        "The sentence presents a contrast between boosting employment (positive) and a concern from critics. Critics would likely be concerned about the reforms worsening inequality, hence 'exacerbate' (make worse) is the correct choice. 'Alleviate' and 'reduce' are positive, while 'nullify' means to make legally void, which doesn't fit.",
